# Web Engineering Coding Playground Template

This repository is designed as the foundation for coding playgrounds in the Web Engineering course. It offers a structured space for experimenting with and mastering various web development technologies and practices. 
The project is based on [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/Accessibility_troubleshooting) repository from MDN.

The project introduces a lot of code smells for you to tackle. 
**Lets get coding!**

## Submission Details and Deadlines
* Coding playgrounds are **individual** work
* There will be 2 serparate submissions:
  * [Base Playgrounds](#base-coding-playgrounds): Submission Deadline **03.11.2024**
  * [Extended Playgrounds](#extended-coding-playgrounds): Submission Deadline **16.01.2025**
* The playgrounds will be guided through in our sessions - still there will be distance work!

## 1. JS Playground (10 Pts.)
The provided base project template contains some bugs and bad JS coding practices for you to fix in your first playground. Take a look into the component files and get a grasp of the inner workings of the provided project.
> **ATTENTION: After finishing the JS Playground please create a commit or branch and link it below. Otherwise it is not possible to grade your 1. submission, since we will switch to TypeScript afterwards!**
> 
> **This is my JS Playground commit/branch:** <LINK_TO_YOUR_COMMIT>

**Tasks:**
Fix application code and answer the questions:
* (2) Adapt the code to use ``async/await`` instead of the ``then()``-callback hell and refactor the functions to use arrow function syntax instead of ``function()``-syntax.
* (2) Add proper error handling to the code using ``try/catch`` and provide useful error messages to the users. Additionally, check the image URL availability before rendering the images in HTML. Provide placeholder images if the given URL does not exist.
* (1) Extract the range value from the provided Wikitext (response from the API). Examine the provided Wikitext format inside `extractBears` function.

# JavaScript Playground - Findings and Improvements

## Overview
This project was refactored to address various bad coding practices and to implement improvements in code structure, readability, and reliability. Below is a summary of the bad practices identified, explanations of why they were problematic, and descriptions of how each was fixed.

---

### 1. Callback Hell Using `.then()` Syntax

**Bad Practice**:
```javascript
fetch(url)
  .then(function(res) {
    return res.json();
  })
  .then(function(data) {
    console.log(data);
  });
```

**Explanation**: Using `.then()` with nested callbacks can lead to "callback hell," making the code difficult to read and maintain.

**Solution - Refactored with `async/await`**:
```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
};
```

**Why It’s Better**: `async/await` provides a cleaner, more readable structure for asynchronous code, making it easier to follow and maintain.

---

### 2. Lack of Error Handling

**Bad Practice**:
```javascript
fetch(url).then(response => response.json());
```

**Explanation**: Not handling errors means that if the fetch fails, the application will fail silently without feedback, leading to poor user experience.

**Solution - Added `try/catch` for Error Handling**:
```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  }
};
```

**Why It’s Better**: Wrapping the code in `try/catch` ensures that any errors are caught and logged, allowing the application to fail gracefully and notify the user if something goes wrong.

---

### 3. Using `var` Instead of `let` or `const`

**Bad Practice**:
```javascript
var count = 0;
```

**Explanation**: Using `var` can lead to unexpected behavior due to hoisting and function scoping, making code harder to debug and predict.

**Solution - Replaced with `let` and `const`**:
```javascript
let count = 0; // use let for mutable variables
const maxCount = 10; // use const for values that won't change
```

**Why It’s Better**: `let` and `const` are block-scoped, which helps avoid unintended variable hoisting and keeps code behavior more predictable.

---

### 4. Direct `innerHTML` Manipulation

**Bad Practice**:
```javascript
element.innerHTML = "<p>" + userInput + "</p>";
```

**Explanation**: Directly setting `innerHTML` can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), especially if the content includes untrusted data.

**Solution - Use `textContent` or Create Elements for Safe Content Manipulation**:
```javascript
const para = document.createElement("p");
para.textContent = userInput; // safer alternative to innerHTML
element.appendChild(para);
```

**Why It’s Better**: Using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` when inserting plain text helps avoid XSS vulnerabilities and makes the code more secure.

---

### 5. Poor Code Organization (Lack of Modularity)

**Bad Practice**: All functionality placed within a single file (`main.js`), making it difficult to maintain and extend.

**Explanation**: Keeping all code in one file leads to poor separation of concerns, makes it harder to find or reuse specific code parts, and complicates debugging.

**Solution - Modularize the Code**:
- Created separate modules (files) for different functionalities:
  - `fetch.js`: Contains API fetching functions.
  - `ui.js`: Contains functions related to updating the DOM.
  - `main.js`: Acts as the entry point, orchestrating the other modules.

**Why It’s Better**: Splitting the code into separate modules helps maintain a clean separation of concerns, making the code easier to navigate, debug, and extend in the future.



``` JS
console.log('Make use of markdown codesnippets to show and explain good/bad practices!')
```


## 2. Dependency- and Build Management Playground (10 Pts.)
Build the application with ``npm`` and a build and a dependency management tool of your choice (e.g. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), or others). 

Here are some additional resources: [Package Management and Bundling](https://github.com/leonardo1710/WebEngineeringSDE/wiki/2-Package-Management,-Build-Management-and-Modules), [Vite Tutorial](https://github.com/leonardo1710/WebEngineeringSDE/wiki/2.1-Vite-Web-Application-Setup), [Webpack Tutorial](https://github.com/leonardo1710/WebEngineeringSDE/wiki/2.2-Webpack-Web-Application-Setup).

**Tasks:**
* (1) Integrate `npm` and a build management tool into your project.
* (2) Configure your project to use Typescript as your primary development language and adapt the code and file extensions respectively.
* (2) Use ESLint and Prettier inside your project - rulesets can be found below.
* (1) Keep your builds clear and add dependencies to the right build (e.g. do not add dev dependencies inside the production build and vice versa).
* (1) Define the following tasks within `npm scripts`:
  * `dev`: starts the development server
  * `build`: runs the typescript compiler and bundles your application - bundling depends on your chosen build tool (e.g. Vite, Webpack) but typically bundles multiple files into one, applies optimizations like minification and obfuscation and outputs final results to a `dist` or `build` directory.
  * `lint`: runs ESLint on all  `.js` and `.ts` files in your projects `/src` directory
  * `lint:fix`: runs and also fixes all issues found by ESLint
  * `format`: formats all `.js` and `.ts` files in your projects `/src` directory
  * `format:check`: checks if the files in the `/src` directory are formatted according to Prettier's rules.
* (1) Configure a pre-commit hook that lints and formats your code using [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged). A tutorial can be found [here](https://dev.to/shashwatnautiyal/complete-guide-to-eslint-prettier-husky-and-lint-staged-fh9).
* (2) Answer the question at the end of this section inside ``Readme.md`` file: 


**ESLint Configurations**

Use ESLint configs [standard-with-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-standard-with-typescript) and [TypeScript ESLint Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin).
Your `.eslintrc` file should have the following extensions:
```.eslintrc.yml
...
extends:
  - standard-with-typescript
  - plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended
  - plugin:prettier/recommended
  - prettier
...
```
 
**Prettier Configurations**

Apply the following ruleset for Prettier:
``` .prettierrc
{
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "printWidth": 80
}
```

## 3.	CI/CD Pipeline Playground (5 Pts.)
Implementation of a CI/CD pipeline to automate the development and deployment process – write automated tests.

Here are some additional resources: [GitHub Actions Tutorial](https://github.com/leonardo1710/WebEngineeringSDE/wiki/3.2-CI-CD-Pipeline-with-Github-Pages-and-Github-Actions) and [GitHub Actions Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

**Tasks:**
* (1.5) Write at least 2 meaningful unit tests (use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) or [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)) for your project and configure the following tasks in ``npm scripts``:
  * `test`: runs all files that include `.test.` or `.spec.`, e.g.: `example.test.ts`
  * `test:coverage`: runs tests like `test` but also creates a test coverage report
* (1) Configure **2 Workflows** in GitHub Actions, one for development and one for deployment:
  * Create a `development` branch inside your repository
  * (1) Development Workflow should at least test and lint your code when developers push to branch `development`
  * (1) Deployment Workflow is triggered when developers push into `main` branch. It should at least test, lint and build your source code. Afterwards the build artifacts of your application should be automatically deployed to Github Pages (or another hosting provider of your choice). 
* (0.5) Reuse existing workflows or jobs whenever possible! 

## 4.	Accessibility Playground (5 Pts.)
You might have noticed that the base project has a number of accessibility issues - your task is to explore the existing site and fix them.
Use the tools presented in our accessibility workshop to test the accessibility in your project.

**(0.5) Color** 

Test the current color contrast (text/background), report the results of the test, and then fix them by changing the assigned colors.

*Present your reports here.*

**(0.5) Semantic HTML**

Report on what happens when you try to navigate the page using a screen reader. Fix those navigation issues.

*Present your reports here.*

**(0.5) Audio** 

The ``<audio>`` player isn't accessible to hearing impaired (deaf) people — can you add some kind of accessible alternative for these users?

*Present your findings and fixes here.*

**(1) Forms** 
  * The ``<input>`` element in the search form at the top could do with a label, but we don't want to add a visible text label that would potentially spoil the design and isn't really needed by sighted users. Fix this issue by adding a label that is only accessible to screen readers.
  * The two ``<input>`` elements in the comment form have visible text labels, but they are not unambiguously associated with their labels — how do you achieve this? Note that you'll need to update some of the CSS rule as well.

*Present your findings and fixes here.*

**(0.5) Comment section**

The show/hide comment control button is not currently keyboard-accessible. Can you make it keyboard accessible, both in terms of focusing it using the tab key, and activating it using the return key?

*Present your findings and fixes here.*

**(1) The table**

The data table is not currently very accessible — it is hard for screen reader users to associate data rows and columns together, and the table also has no kind of summary to make it clear what it shows. Can you add some features to your HTML to fix this problem?

*Present your findings and fixes here.*

**(1) More Findings**

What other accessibility issues did you find? Explain how you did fix them.

# Extended Coding Playgrounds

## 5. Migrate to a Frontend Framework (10 pts.)
In this playground you will migrate your application to a frontend framework of your choice.

**Tasks**:
* Migrate your application to a frontend framework of your choice (e.g. React, Angular, Vue.js, Svelte,...)
  * All previous features should still work
  * The application still should use build and dependency management
* Adapt your `npm scripts` if necessary

## 6. Integrate a Backend Framework (10 pts.)
In this playground you will use a backend framework of your choice and connect it with an API to your frontend application. 

**Tasks**:
* (3) Setup a backend framework of your choice
* (2) Create an API your frontend will be connected to (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, you choose...)
* (2) Your backend should now request the bear data from presented Wikipedia API
* (3) Replace the frontend Wikipedia API calls with calls to your backend - the functionality of your frontend should work as before!
* (Optional): you may want to introduce some sort of caching layer for Wikipedia API requests


## 7. Containerize your application (10 pts.)
Dockerize your frontend and backend applications. It should be possible to start all services in the corresponding mode (development, production) with a single command (e.g. use Docker Compose for this).

**Tasks**:
* (6) Create **multi-stage Dockerfiles** for your applications (depending on your frameworks):
  * The frontend Dockerfile should: 1. run the app in a development environment 2. build the app 3. serve build artefacts over Nginx
  * The backend Dockerfile should: 1. run the app in a development environment 2. build the app if there is a build step in your framework (optional) 3. serve the app 
* (4) Create two docker-compose files to orchestrate you applications in ``development`` and ``production`` mode:
  * Define ports and dependencies
  * Define corresponding stage (development, production)
  * Use environment variables if possible
* Your application should start with the following commands:
  * Development: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build`
  * Production: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build`
